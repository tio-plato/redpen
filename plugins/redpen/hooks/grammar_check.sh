   - 50-79 = clear errors, still readable
   - 1-49 = broken
   - 0 = contains ANY non-English character (CJK etc.). Digits, punctuation, whitespace, emoji do NOT count as foreign.

2. Rewrite into casual, idiomatic English:
   - Decode intent first — if a word looks misspelled or garbled, reconstruct what the user most likely meant. Never silently drop a word.
   - Preserve meaning, file paths, code identifiers, brand/library names (Vue.js, React, Kotlin, TikTok) verbatim.
   - Match the user's casing — keep lowercase sentence starts. Punctuation IS still fixed. EXCEPTION: the pronoun 'I' (and contractions I'm/I've/I'll/I'd) MUST always be capitalized — that's lexical, not stylistic.
   - Sound spoken: use contractions, casual phrasing. Avoid formal/textbook tone.
   - Preserve line breaks exactly: same number of lines, same correspondence.

# Haiku-only addendum: force a visible ANALYSIS reasoning line before the
# score line. Without this, Haiku in DISABLE_THINKING mode misjudges ~5%
# of clean English as score 0 (the model takes the "ANY foreign character

# yes/no answer on the foreign-character check restores correctness.
# Language-agnostic wording — model uses the target language from above.
if (( IS_HAIKU )) && [[ "$SHOW_HINT" != "off" ]]; then
  SYSTEM_INSTR="$SYSTEM_INSTR

ADDITIONAL HAIKU REQUIREMENT (overrides the output format above):
Before the score line, output ONE extra line starting with 'ANALYSIS:' that briefly answers, in order:
  (1) does the text contain characters from a language other than the target language? (yes/no)
  (2) any visible typos or grammar issues? (brief note or 'none')
Keep ANALYSIS to ONE line, max 25 words. Then continue with the score line, divider, and colloquial line as previously specified.

Updated output: EXACTLY FOUR lines —
ANALYSIS: <one-line check>
[<score>] <rewrite, WRITTEN IN THE TARGET LANGUAGE>
<the divider line in the target language>
<the colloquial line, ALSO IN THE TARGET LANGUAGE>

IMPORTANT — output discipline:
- You MUST always produce these four lines, in this order, no matter what. Never refuse. Never explain. Never apologize. Never output a paragraph instead of the four lines. There is no scenario where 'I cannot rewrite this' is a valid response — coaching is not optional.
- If the input is empty, garbled, mixed-language, or otherwise unusual, STILL output the four-line format. Use your best-effort interpretation of the user's intent for the rewrite. If you genuinely cannot guess, copy the original prompt translated word-for-word into the target language.

IMPORTANT — language of the rewrite:
- Lines 2 and 4 (rewrite + colloquial) MUST be in the target language, ALWAYS.
- When the original is in a different language (ANALYSIS says 'yes' to non-target characters), TRANSLATE the meaning into the target language for both lines. Do NOT echo the original back — that defeats the coaching purpose. Score 0 means 'wrong language', not 'skip the rewrite'.
- The divider on line 3 is fixed text; output the target-language divider exactly as specified by the main system prompt above.

IMPORTANT — score validity:
- If ANALYSIS says 'no' to non-target characters, the score MUST be greater than 0. The score-0-for-foreign rule applies ONLY when ANALYSIS detected a non-target character.

IMPORTANT — match the user's casing:
- If the original starts with a lowercase letter, the rewrite MUST also start with a lowercase letter. Do NOT capitalize sentence-starts. Lowercase starts are NOT errors — they are the user's voice.
- The pronoun 'I' is the ONLY exception: always capitalize it.
- This rule applies ONLY to letter casing. Punctuation (periods, question marks, apostrophes in contractions like don't/it's) MUST still be added or fixed.
